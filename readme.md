  - It breaks the instruction into operations like “add,” “move,” or “load.”  

- **Execute**:  
  - The ALU performs the required operation (arithmetic, logical, or shift operations).  
  - The result is stored in a register or memory.

---

#### **Arithmetic, Logical, and Shift Operations**  

- **Arithmetic Operations**:

  - **NOT (!)**: Inverts a value (true becomes false, false becomes true).  
    - **Example**: `NOT 1 = 0`  
  - **XOR (Exclusive OR)**: Returns true only if one operand is true, but not both.  
    - **Example**: `1 XOR 0 = 1`  

---

  - Move bits to the left (for multiplication by powers of 2) or to the right (for division by powers of 2).  
  - **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts bits to the left, multiplying by 2.  
    - **Example**: `4 << 1 = 8` (binary 100 becomes 1000)  
  - **Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts bits to the right, dividing by 2.  
    - **Example**: `8 >> 1 = 4` (binary 1000 becomes 100)
