### link padene ke liye -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY2gz_Kzc0Q(click here)
### **1. Arithmetic Operations**  
Arithmetic operations perform basic mathematical calculations.

- **Addition (+)**  
  - Adds two numbers.  
  - **Example**: `5 + 3 = 8`  

- **Subtraction (-)**  
  - Subtracts the second number from the first.  
  - **Example**: `10 - 4 = 6`  

- **Multiplication (*)**  
  - Multiplies two numbers.  
  - **Example**: `6 * 2 = 12`  

- **Division (/)**  
  - Divides the first number by the second.  
  - **Example**: `20 / 5 = 4`  

---

### **2. Logical Operations**  
Logical operations are used to compare binary values (1s and 0s) and return a true/false result.

- **AND (&&)**  
  - Returns true if both operands are true.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```  
    1 AND 1 = 1  
    1 AND 0 = 0  
    ```  

- **OR (||)**  
  - Returns true if at least one operand is true.

    ```  
    1 OR 0 = 1  
    0 OR 0 = 0  
    ```  

- **NOT (!)**  
  - Inverts a value (true becomes false, false becomes true).  
  - **Example**:  
    ```  
    NOT 1 = 0  
    NOT 0 = 1  
    ```  

- **XOR (Exclusive OR)**  
  - Returns true only if one of the operands is true, but not both.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```  
    1 XOR 1 = 0

### **3. Shift Operations**  
Shift operations move bits to the left (for multiplication by powers of 2) or to the right (for division by powers of 2).

- **Left Shift (<<)**  
  - Shifts bits to the left, multiplying the number by 2.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```  
    4 << 1 = 8  
    ```  
    (4 in binary is 100; shifting left by 1 becomes 1000, which is 8 in decimal)  

- **Right Shift (>>)**  
  - Shifts bits to the right, dividing the number by 2.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```  
    8 >> 1 = 4  
    ```  
    (8 in binary is 1000; shifting right by 1 becomes 100, which is 4 in decimal)
